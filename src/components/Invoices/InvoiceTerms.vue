      <li>
        The total sales price is due upon purchase. If for any reason, there is
        still an open balance, it shall become overdue on the day after the sale
        has taken place. If the invoice becomes overdue, a delay interest rate
        of 18% per year shall be enforceable until the invoice is paid off in
        full.
      </li>
      <li>
        If for any reason, the seller would have to go to the buyer to collect a
        payment, there will be an additional distance charge of Afl. 25,00 for
        each time.
      </li>
      <li>
        If for any reason the invoice (and additional charges as described in
        articles 1 and 2) is still not paid off after 30 days, the seller
        retains the right to collect the overdue amount with the help of an
        attorney, bailiff, or debt collection agency of choice. All legal and/or
        extrajudicial costs will ultimately be borne by the buyer.
      </li>
      <li>
        The buyer purchases the described items “as is where is”, and hereby
        accepts that there is no return policy.
      </li>
      <li>
        The buyer shall take the purchased items with him immediately after
        completion of the purchase. If for any reason the buyer needs to come
        pick up any of the purchased items on a later date, these items can only
        be claimed after presentation of this original (signed) invoice. If for
        any reason the purchased items are still unclaimed three (3) days after
        the sale has taken place, the buyer shall no longer be entitled to claim
        these items. The already paid money shall be considered fees for
        cancellation of sale and for storage of the items.
      </li>
      <li>
        Upon signing this invoice, the buyer accepts all the terms and
        conditions of the sale.
